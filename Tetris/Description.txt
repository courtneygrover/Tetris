Name: Courtney Grover
Worked with: Bragdon Bester

Project: Tetris

Extra credit:

-Theme
   >Background, colors
-Sounds
   >Different sounds for when 1 row vs 2 rows vs 3 vs 4 rows are completed
   >Sound when game is lost
   >Sound when level up
   >Sound when blocks hit something

Shortcomings:

-Definitely not the most efficient solution. For example, we re-draw the entire board quite often.
-Sound when blocks hit seems to lag.
-Sometimes when up arrow is pressed, blocks shift up rather than rotate???
-Rotation also is not very user friendly to me; hard to get used to
